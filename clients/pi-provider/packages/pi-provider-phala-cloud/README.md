# pi-provider-phala-cloud

Phala Cloud Confidential AI for Pi, powered by [private-ai-gateway].

A thin, Phala Cloud-branded distribution of the vendor-neutral
[`@phala/pi-provider-aci`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@phala/pi-provider-aci).
It sends inference over an attested, SPKI-pinned gateway connection and requires
verified provider serving. Remote plaintext is limited to the accepted gateway
and provider workloads. Every response receipt is verified before Pi can finish
the model turn or continue its tool loop.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-provider-phala-cloud
```

Start Pi, complete the native device login, wait for the verified connection,
then save a default model from the native model picker:

```text
/login phala
# choose Phala Cloud account or Phala Cloud API key
# complete login and wait for the footer to show aci-verified
/model
# search for phala/, select a model, and press Ctrl+S
```

The account flow issues a Confidential AI API key; the manual method accepts an
existing key. Both return the same native API-key credential to Pi. Pi stores it
in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`, the refreshed catalog in
`~/.pi/agent/models-store.json`, and the saved default in
`~/.pi/agent/settings.json`. These values survive a restart and the cached
catalog remains available offline. As an alternative for one process, set
`PHALA_AI_API_KEY`; Pi does not copy environment variables into its credential
store.

Config: `/phala-settings` · Attestation status: `/phala-attestation` · Receipt
history: `/phala-receipts` · Receipt audit: `/phala-receipt` · Session
inspection: `/phala-session`

Attestation and every response receipt are verified automatically. The commands
only display the evidence or rerun an audit. The local wire-digest history keeps
the latest 32 receipt-bearing requests by default and is cleared when Pi exits;
gateway receipt and session artifacts have their own server-side retention.

It shares its verifier and provider core with `pi-provider-redpill`, but the two
packages have different product IDs, authentication options, and default
endpoints. If you operate your own private-ai-gateway, use the neutral
[`@phala/pi-provider-aci`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@phala/pi-provider-aci) instead.
