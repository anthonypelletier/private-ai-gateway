# `@phala/aci-provider`

Use this package to add ACI provider behavior to a host that already owns its
authentication UI, model picker, and persistence. It combines the verified
transport with live model discovery, TEE filtering, capability mapping, bounded
receipt history, optional response-completion verification, and session
inspection.

Host adapters such as Pi and OpenCode supply their native configuration and UI.
Applications normally install a host adapter rather than this package directly.
Use `connectAci()` from `@phala/aci-verifier/runtime` instead when you need only
a verified `fetch` transport.

## Install

```bash
npm install @phala/aci-provider
```

Shared RedPill and Phala Cloud profiles are exported from
`@phala/aci-provider/profiles`. Phala Cloud's account API and device
authorization flow are isolated under `@phala/aci-provider/phala-cloud`; they
are not part of the ACI protocol or verifier.

## Create a provider

```ts
import {
  createAciProvider,
  resolveAciProviderConfig,
  resolveAciProviderProfile,
} from "@phala/aci-provider";

const profile = resolveAciProviderProfile({
  defaultBaseURL: "https://gateway.example.com/v1",
});
const provider = createAciProvider(resolveAciProviderConfig(profile));

await provider.connect();
const response = await provider.fetch("https://gateway.example.com/v1/chat/completions", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.ACI_API_KEY}` },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: "model-id",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Say hi" }],
  }),
});

await provider.close();
```

The provider fails closed: model traffic is sent only after workload attestation
and TLS SPKI binding succeed. Set `receipts.verification` to `"response"` to
make a response stream finish or settle consumer cancellation only after its
signed receipt and cited session have verified.

## Model catalog

Model discovery uses the verified connection but sends no inference API key;
the gateway's `/v1/models` catalog is public. Host adapters own credentials and
attach them only to inference requests.

The catalog is authoritative. The provider maps reasoning and tools only from
`supported_features`, and temperature only from
`supported_sampling_parameters`. It does not infer capabilities, family,
limits, modalities, or request dialects from model ids. Malformed required
metadata fails discovery instead of being replaced with guessed defaults.
Optional cache prices remain absent when the catalog omits them.

## Receipts, sessions, and inspection

`provider.receipts()` returns the bounded in-process exchange history, newest
first. `provider.verifyReceipt()` verifies the latest exchange when no id is
given, while `provider.verifySession(id)` fetches the public session artifact
over the pinned connection and validates its content address, API version,
validity window, and evidence digest.

Host integrations can use one structured inspection contract for status,
attestation, receipt history, receipt verification, and session verification:

```ts
import { formatAciInspection, inspectAciProvider } from "@phala/aci-provider";

const result = await inspectAciProvider(provider, { action: "receipt" });
console.log(formatAciInspection(result));
```

## Product authentication

Products that exchange account authorization for an inference API key implement
the host-neutral `AccountApiKeyAuth` contract. It describes the browser/device
step and returns one API key plus optional metadata; host adapters present it
and persist the result through native auth APIs. Phala Cloud provides the
shared factory directly:

```ts
import { createPhalaCloudAccountAuth } from "@phala/aci-provider/phala-cloud";

const accountAuth = createPhalaCloudAccountAuth({
  baseURL: "https://cloud-api.phala.com",
  clientId: "my-agent",
});
```

This product authentication contract is separate from ACI verification.
RedPill currently has no account authorization implementation and remains
API-key-only.
