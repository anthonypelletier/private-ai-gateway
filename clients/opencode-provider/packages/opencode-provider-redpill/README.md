# `opencode-provider-redpill`

RedPill's native OpenCode provider. OpenCode `1.18.24` or newer is recommended.
Install it globally through OpenCode's official plugin command:

```sh
opencode plugin opencode-provider-redpill --global
```

Restart OpenCode after installing, then use its native provider and model
pickers:

```text
/connect
# search for RedPill AI and enter the API key
/models
# search for redpill/ and select a model
```

OpenCode persists the plugin entry and credential in its own configuration and
auth store. `REDPILL_AI_API_KEY` is also supported for the current process, but
environment variables are not copied into the auth store. RedPill does not
currently expose account OAuth. Select `redpill/<model-id>` in OpenCode. The
plugin discovers current TEE models and sends inference only through an
attested, TLS-pinned connection.

Attestation is verified before model discovery, and each response receipt is
verified before OpenCode can finish the turn. These commands display the local
evidence; they do not enable or weaken enforcement:

```text
/redpill-attestation
/redpill-receipts
/redpill-receipt [receipt-id]
/redpill-session <session-id>
```

They dispatch the read-only `redpill_aci_inspect` tool. The local wire-digest
history keeps the latest 32 receipt-bearing requests by default and is cleared
when OpenCode exits. Gateway receipt and session artifacts have their own
server-side retention.

Do not add a separate `provider.redpill` block. The plugin registers the
provider, model catalog, verified fetch, and auth loader through OpenCode's
native server-plugin API.
