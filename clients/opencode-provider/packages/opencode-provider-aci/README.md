# `@phala/opencode-provider-aci`

Native OpenCode provider for an ACI gateway. The plugin registers the provider,
discovers its live model catalog over an attested and SPKI-pinned connection,
maps reasoning/tool/modality/cost/limit metadata, and verifies every inference
receipt before the response stream can finish.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "package": "@phala/opencode-provider-aci",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://gateway.example.com/v1",
        "trust": {
          "acceptedComposeHashes": ["<reviewed-compose-sha256>"],
        },
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

On OpenCode 1 the same package keeps working through the V1 tuple form
(`"plugin": [["@phala/opencode-provider-aci", { ... }]]`). The default export
exposes both the V2 `setup` definition and the V1 `server` hook object.

After adding the configured plugin tuple above, restart OpenCode and use its
native provider and model pickers:

```text
/connect
# search for ACI and enter the API key
/models
# search for aci/ and select a model
```

The neutral package has no default gateway, so `baseURL` must be configured.
`ACI_API_KEY` is also supported for the current process, but environment
variables are not copied into OpenCode's auth store.

The plugin discovers the public `/v1/models` catalog over the verified
connection without sending the inference API key. OpenCode stores the key and
attaches it to model requests through its native credential flow. The plugin
uses OpenCode's V1 server-plugin hooks or its V2 provider, integration, tool,
command, and `aisdk` hooks; on V2 the verified transport is installed by
replacing the AI SDK provider inside the SDK hook, because a V2 provider
transform cannot carry a `fetch` function. It does not maintain parallel config
or credential files.

Capability flags come only from the catalog. The plugin does not create
model-family variants or rewrite reasoning parameters; OpenCode's official
OpenAI-compatible provider handles its standard reasoning request and response
fields.
Optional cache prices stay absent when the catalog does not publish them.

The plugin registers `/aci-attestation`, `/aci-receipts`, `/aci-receipt [id]`,
and `/aci-session <id>` as native OpenCode custom commands. On OpenCode V2 each
command inspects the verified connection directly and posts the formatted
result, so no model turn or tokens are involved; on V1 the commands ask the
selected model to call the read-only `aci_inspect` tool. Both expose the tool's
five actions: `status`, `attestation`,
`receipts`, `receipt`, and `session`. Receipt inspection verifies the latest
recorded exchange when no id is supplied. Session inspection requires the bare
64-hex session id and verifies its content address, API version, validity
window, and evidence digest. The tool returns verification metadata only,
never model traffic or raw evidence. Branded plugins scope both commands and
the tool name to their provider id. Commands you define yourself with the same
name take precedence; that check runs when the plugin loads.

The plugin definition for OpenCode V2 is loaded lazily from `./v2`, so V1
hosts never import the V2 plugin SDK or the AI SDK provider just to load the
server-plugin entrypoint.

## OpenCode 2 terminal extension

On OpenCode 2 the package also ships a terminal extension (`./tui`, loaded by
the CLI beside the server plugin):

- a footer status badge: `ACI ✓ <provider>` when the gateway is verified,
  `…` while verifying, `✗` when blocked;
- a Verification Center panel opened with `/aci`, showing the end-to-end,
  verified-software, and confidential-hardware checks, the gateway identity,
  keyset validity, model and receipt counts, and the latest receipts;
- `r` inside the panel runs verification again through the server plugin.

The panel and badge read the server state over the plugin RPC
(`@phala/opencode-provider-aci/rpc`), so they also work when the CLI is
connected to a remote OpenCode server.

Attestation and response receipt verification are automatic and fail closed;
the commands only display evidence or rerun an audit. The local wire-digest
history keeps the latest 32 receipt-bearing requests by default and is cleared
when OpenCode exits. Credential persistence and gateway artifact retention are
independent of this local history.

Do not also configure a separate `provider.aci`. The plugin owns that provider
so installation, attestation, or channel-binding failure leaves no ordinary
HTTPS path available.

Programmatic branded plugins may pass a shared `AccountApiKeyAuth` as
`accountAuth`. The core maps it into OpenCode's official browser auth hook and
automatically keeps the manual API-key method; the brand does not build its own
OpenCode credential flow.
